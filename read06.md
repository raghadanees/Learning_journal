## JAVASCRIPT

### This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. 


- We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files..
- JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
- The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file 
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
