## JavaScript 
can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive,interesting, and user-friendly. You will also learn about jQuery because it makes writing JavaScript a lot easier
so you can
- Access the content of the page
- MODIFY CONTENT
You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example: Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element
- REACT TO EVENTS
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
â€¢ A button is pressed, A link is clicked (or tapped) on or A web page has finished loading
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser
